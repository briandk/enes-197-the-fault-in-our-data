# Hello Plot with Python

There's lots of stuff to do in Python; let's start with a plot!

## Plotting the `diamonds` dataset

Our first plot is going to make use of the `diamonds` dataset that ships with [`plotnine`](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine).

We'll import the necessary stuff from `plotnine` first. It seems like a lot of imports, but I made them all explicit so you can trace which parts of the code come from the `plotnine` library.
